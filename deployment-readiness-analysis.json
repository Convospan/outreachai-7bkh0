  "summary": "The application has shifted to a Chrome extension-based model for LinkedIn interactions, removing direct LinkedIn API calls for OAuth and messaging from the Next.js app. This simplifies backend LinkedIn logic but makes the Chrome extension's functionality critical. Core API integrations for SendPulse (email) and Sarvam (AI calling) remain placeholders ('Coming Soon'). The most significant blocker is ensuring all necessary environment variables (API keys, Firebase config) are correctly set as GitHub Secrets and successfully injected by the CI/CD pipeline. Firebase Admin SDK initialization needs runtime verification.",

  "summary": "The application has environment variables provided for most services. However, critical Google Calendar OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret) are still missing (empty strings in .env). Additionally, core API integrations for LinkedIn, SendPulse, Sarvam, and Google Calendar require implementation of actual API call logic beyond initial setup or OAuth flows. Firebase App Check status needs verification. Security rules and basic database operations are in place but require thorough testing.",

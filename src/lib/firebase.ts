/*

This code is for backend Firebase Admin SDK initialization.  It's not suitable for a frontend file.

Backend code like this should be inside Next.js API routes (in the `pages/api` directory if you're using the Pages Router, or the `app/api` directory with the App Router).  API routes are server-side only.

Also, ensure that `process.env.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is properly set in your hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting).

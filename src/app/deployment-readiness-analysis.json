Firebase client/server environment variables have been defined in the .env example, but their availability and correctness during the CI/CD build process and runtime needs strict verification. Core API integrations for LinkedIn, SendPulse, and Sarvam are still using placeholder logic and are critical for full functionality. Firebase App Check is currently disabled. Firebase Security Rules and basic database operations are defined but require thorough end-to-end testing once actual data flows through the system.",
